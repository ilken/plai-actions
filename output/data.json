        "probability": 55,
        "analysis": "Tottenham have a stronger record and are playing at home. While Villa have been inconsistent, they can score goals. Tottenham's slightly better defensive record gives them the edge."

        "probability": 50,
        "analysis": "Tottenham's games average close to 2 goals, while Villa's are lower. However, both teams have the potential to score, making over 2.5 goals a reasonable possibility."

        "prediction": "Liverpool FC Win",
        "probability": 60,
        "analysis": "Liverpool are in better form and have a superior goal difference compared to Manchester United. Playing at home further strengthens Liverpool's position. Man United's struggles in front of goal make a Liverpool win more likely."

        "prediction": "Under 2.5 Goals",
        "probability": 55,
        "analysis": "Liverpool's recent games have been relatively low-scoring. Man United have also struggled to score. While Liverpool can score, it may be a tight affair."

        "prediction": "No",
        "probability": 60,
        "analysis": "Man United's lack of goals in recent games, combined with Liverpool's solid defense, makes it unlikely that both teams will score."

        "probability": 45,
        "analysis": "West Ham's poor form and defensive vulnerabilities make them susceptible. Brentford, despite being lower in the table, have shown attacking potential.  It's a close call, but Brentford's slightly better form makes them marginal favorites."

        "prediction": "Over 2.5 Goals",
